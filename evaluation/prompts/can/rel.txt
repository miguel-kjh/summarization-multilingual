You will be given one summary written for a legislative document.

Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please read the instructions carefully.

Important:
The summaries in this dataset are intentionally short and procedural.
They focus on selecting key procedural information (e.g., participants,
roles, and intervention flow), rather than summarizing thematic or
argumentative content.

Evaluation Criteria:

Relevance (1-5) – the appropriateness of the information selected for a
procedural summary of a legislative session.

A relevant summary:
- includes the most important procedural elements of the session,
- focuses on key participants and their roles,
- avoids unnecessary details or irrelevant information.

The summary should NOT be penalized for:
- omitting thematic content or arguments,
- being highly selective by design.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Identify the key procedural elements in the document (main speakers,
   roles, and general flow of interventions).
2. Assess whether the summary selects the most relevant of these elements
   for a brief procedural overview.
3. Check whether the summary avoids irrelevant or excessive information.
4. Assign a relevance score from 1 to 5 based on these criteria.

Example:

Source Text:
{{Document}}

Summary:

Output format:
Return ONLY a single integer number between 1 and 5.
Do not include any text, labels, or explanations.
