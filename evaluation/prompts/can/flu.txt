You will be given one summary written for a legislative document.

Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please read the instructions carefully.

Important:
The summaries in this dataset are intentionally short and procedural.
They often use formal, administrative language and list-like structures.
This style is appropriate and should NOT be penalized.

Evaluation Criteria:

Fluency (1-3): the quality of the summary in terms of basic language correctness,
including grammar, spelling, punctuation, and overall readability.

Fluency should be judged independently of:
- the length of the summary,
- its level of detail,
- its stylistic richness or narrative quality.

Scoring Guidelines:
- 1 (Poor): The summary contains frequent grammatical, spelling, or punctuation
  errors that make it difficult to understand.
- 2 (Fair): The summary contains some minor errors, but remains generally clear
  and readable.
- 3 (Good): The summary is grammatically correct, clear, and easy to read,
  even if it is brief or list-like in structure.

Example:

Summary:

Output format:
Return ONLY a single integer number between 1 and 3.
Do not include any text, labels, or explanations.
