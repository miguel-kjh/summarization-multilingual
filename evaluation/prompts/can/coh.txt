You will be given one summary written for a legislative document.

Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

Important:
The summaries in this dataset are intentionally very short and procedural.
They are designed to list participants and reflect the flow of interventions,
not to develop arguments or summarize thematic content in detail.

Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5) – the clarity and internal consistency of the summary as a
procedural description. A coherent summary should:
- be easy to read,
- present information in a logical and consistent order,
- avoid abrupt jumps, contradictions, or confusing structure.

The summary does NOT need to:
- cover the main arguments of the document,
- describe the topic in detail,
- or form a narrative body of information about a topic.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the summary carefully.
2. Assess whether the sentences are logically ordered and internally consistent
   as a brief procedural account of the session.
3. Determine whether the summary is clear and well-structured given its
   intentionally concise and list-like nature.
4. Assign a coherence score from 1 to 5 based on the criteria above.

Example:

Source Text:
{{Document}}

Summary:
{{Summary}}

Output format:
Return ONLY a single integer number between 1 and 5.
Do not include any text, labels, or explanations.
