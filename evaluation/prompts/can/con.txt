You will be given a legislative document. You will then be given one summary
written for this document.

Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please read the instructions carefully.

Important:
The summaries in this dataset are intentionally short and procedural.
They focus on listing participants, roles, and the flow of interventions.
They do NOT aim to include all factual or thematic details of the document.

Evaluation Criteria:

Consistency (1-5) – the factual alignment between the summary and the source
document at the procedural level.

A factually consistent summary:
- mentions only speakers, roles, and events that are supported by the document,
- does not hallucinate participants, roles, or actions,
- does not contradict the procedural structure of the session.

The summary should NOT be penalized for:
- omitting thematic content or detailed facts,
- being highly selective by design.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Verify whether each factual statement in the summary (e.g., speaker names,
   roles, order of interventions) is supported by the document.
2. Check for hallucinated or incorrect procedural information.
3. Assign a consistency score from 1 to 5 based on factual correctness only.

Example:

Source Text:
{{Document}}

Summary:
{{Summary}}

Output format:
Return ONLY a single integer number between 1 and 5.
Do not include any text, labels, or explanations.
